# DittoBox-Testing

This repository contains the comprehensive Testing Suite for the DittoBox project. It includes Unit Tests, Integration Tests, and Acceptance Tests (BDD). All tests are designed to ensure the functionality and integrity of the system based on the User Stories specified in each Sprint.

## Repository Structure:

- **Unit Tests**: Tests for individual classes and behaviors.
- **Integration Tests**: Tests to verify the interaction between different components.
- **Acceptance Tests (BDD)**: Behavior-Driven Development tests with `.feature` files written in Gherkin, and corresponding Step definitions in the project's programming language.

Each test is related to specific User Stories or features and is tracked through version control commits for traceability. This repository also includes the feature files and testing evidence for Sprint Review purposes.

## Version Control:
For each Sprint, commits related to testing are documented for traceability, ensuring consistent tracking of testing progress and updates.
